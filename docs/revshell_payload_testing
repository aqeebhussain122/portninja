Step 1:
  Create a network socket.



Function to print errors from processers
'buffer' = amount of characters read from the socket

We create the server and client address using a struct known as sockaddr_in

'htons' - thin layer between the code and how its interpreted in memory (network byte order)

file descriptors as we are essential accessing.


memset is libary to initilize memory from a start point to an endpoint for the data to populated
bzero adds 0's into sections of memory

Extra:
"A socket is an abstraction of a communication endpoint"
