Layout of Program: 
• An attacker uses command execution from the target box to execute the client payload. 
• The client payload connect to a malicious server on port x.
• The attacking server listens on port x for the clients connection, once recieved the connection is bound and occupies port x. 
• The attacking server establishes and maintains that connection by creating a socket, binding to a port and listening for a connection to come through. 
• Commands are transmit from server to client over the wire by encoded bytes. Once recieved on client-side, they are decoded to data-type string. 
• The client payload listens for the server commands and executes them in string format using a while loop with hardcoded commands and their functionality. It does so using its own subprocess.



TLDR: Sever & Client maintain a connection, server sends requests, client executes requests with hardcoded functionality within its local payload.
=================================================================================================================================================================================
What else do we need to do:

- full pty capabilites - 
- shell encryption -
- testing
=================================================================================================================================================================================

Full PTY capabilites (cop):
• usage
• commands and their functionality
• error handling
• subprocess

GOAL: Understand the inner workings of a shell.
========================================================
Usage:

- cntl+c to exit 
- cntrl+r to see previous commands?!?


========================================================
Commands + their functionality:

lets use a template as we'll be building so many commands:
Temp template pseudo code:

  if command = ...
     os.chdir(command[...])
     execute
     print results
	
========================================================
Error handling:

• timeout function() - If the host is suddenly dead then just pull out OR AFK for a certain amount of time
• try and catch statments.
• print errors back to us?


========================================================
SubProcess Section:

So to create our own sub process we need to build our own package of commands.
Pre-built bash shell everyone uses (naw)

...


========================================================
Extra:

--------------------------
Each time an command is input the client payload will scan over every hardcoded if statement. This may be a better way to do it but idk:

array_commands[cd, ls, ..., ...,]
if argv1 = array_commands SUCCESS
else exit()

----------------------------

=================================================================================================================================================================================
Shell encryption: 

- Future thing
- use SIM (steal insult modify) 










=================================================================================================================================================================================
Testing zone:
...
...
...






=================================================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================================================
Old:
Create a reliable network program to send data between a network sender and listener (reverse shell)

Create a network Socket 
  •
  •
  •
Create our own Shell (C programming job and will serve as part of the payload being sent over the wire)
  •
  •
  •
Create a client Payload
  •
  •
  •
Create a python server to which the target connects to via command injection (Command & Control) 
  • create() - Create the socket
  • bind() - Bind the socket to a port 
  • accept() - Accept a connection which comes in and create a blocking state
  • send_commands() - Send commands to the recieved payload with encoding
  • receive_commands() - Print and receive the appropriate decoded output for us to interact with the target. 
  
Client-Sever:
  Description:
    Attacker: Netcat connection (Socket open on port) <- That socket then catches a known payload such as Python, perl or whatever to open bin/sh or bin/bash
    Our case: We create a server in which we handle sockets, create, bind, accept sockets then we send/receive commands back & forth to our target via reverse shell mechanism.
    
    
  • Currently building both the client functionality & the python sever - (Reference & base code) -  https://www.thepythoncode.com/code/create-reverse-shell-python
  • Most of the PoC done, once error handling is complete.
  • Subprocess work to do.
============================================================================================================================
Older:
  
Create a network socket.
---------
Function to print errors from processers
'buffer' = amount of characters read from the socket
---------
We create the server and client address using a struct known as sockaddr_in
---------
'htons' - thin layer between the code and how its interpreted in memory (network byte order)
  how the binary and the machine interprets the port number.
  converts a port number in host byte order to a port number in network byte order.
---------
memset is libary to initilize memory from a start point to an endpoint for the data to populated
bzero adds 0's into sections of memory
  First zero out an entire memory space from point a to b. Then we initialize our own variables into it.
---------
Next stage:
Make our own reliable network program to send data between a network sender and listener. reverse shell
---------
Extra:
"A socket is an abstraction of a communication endpoint"
file descriptors as we are essential accessing a file.
