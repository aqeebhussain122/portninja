New:
Create a reliable network program to send data between a network sender and listener (reverse shell)

Create a network Socket 
  •
  •
  •
Create our own Shell (C programming job and will serve as part of the payload being sent over the wire)
  •
  •
  •
Create a client Payload
  •
  •
  •
Create a python server to which the target connects to via command injection (Command & Control) 
  • create() - Create the socket
  • bind() - Bind the socket to a port 
  • accept() - Accept a connection which comes in and create a blocking state
  • send_commands() - Send commands to the recieved payload with encoding
  • receive_commands() - Print and receive the appropriate decoded output for us to interact with the target. 
============================================================================================================================
Old:
  
Create a network socket.
---------
Function to print errors from processers
'buffer' = amount of characters read from the socket
---------
We create the server and client address using a struct known as sockaddr_in
---------
'htons' - thin layer between the code and how its interpreted in memory (network byte order)
  how the binary and the machine interprets the port number.
  converts a port number in host byte order to a port number in network byte order.
---------
memset is libary to initilize memory from a start point to an endpoint for the data to populated
bzero adds 0's into sections of memory
  First zero out an entire memory space from point a to b. Then we initialize our own variables into it.
---------
Next stage:
Make our own reliable network program to send data between a network sender and listener. reverse shell
---------
Extra:
"A socket is an abstraction of a communication endpoint"
file descriptors as we are essential accessing a file.
