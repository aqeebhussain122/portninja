GOOD POINTS:
Program is able to banner grab successfully and declare 
if a port is open or closed

THINGS TO IMPROVE:
Does not other computers too well
Crashes if a service is not available
Since TCP has a standard type of blocking socket
it awaits activity, in some cases it will not recieve it at all
In that case it waits (NOT GOOD)

TEST PLAN #1

NMAP scan of local machine
22/tcp   open  ssh
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
631/tcp  open  ipp
3306/tcp open  mysql
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

test of ssh - 22
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 22 open
Banner is SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 Ubuntu-4

Test of DNS - 53
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 53 open
(stuck) No action

Addition to code with sockettimeout function causes following result
--------------------------------------
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 53 open
('Exception', timeout('timed out',))
---------------------------------------
(After 5 seconds of wait)
