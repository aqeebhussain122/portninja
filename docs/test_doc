GOOD POINTS:
Program is able to banner grab successfully and declare 
if a port is open or closed

THINGS TO IMPROVE:
Does not work with other computers too well
Crashes if a service is not available
Since TCP has a standard type of blocking socket
it awaits activity, in some cases it will not recieve it at all
In that case it waits (NOT GOOD)

TEST PLAN #1

NMAP scan of local machine
22/tcp   open  ssh
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
631/tcp  open  ipp
3306/tcp open  mysql
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

test of ssh - 22
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 22 open
Banner is SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 Ubuntu-4

Test of DNS - 53
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 53 open
(stuck) No action

Addition to code with sockettimeout function causes following result
--------------------------------------
IP Address is: 127.0.0.1
Port 53 open
('Exception', timeout('timed out',))
---------------------------------------
(After 5 seconds of wait)

Good points:
Scans on other machines are successful
If a service is not available the system will timeout in 5 secs
Banners are retrieved from all TCP services

Bad points:
Ports scans cannot perform banner grabs on UDP ports
Does not work well with Windows as of this moment


Test Plan #1

NMAP Ports available on machine:
135/tcp  open  msrpc - 
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
2701/tcp open  sms-rcinfo
3000/tcp open  ppp
8192/tcp open  sophos
8194/tcp open  sophos


Results:
Port 135 open
('Exception', timeout('timed out',))

Port 139 open
Banner is �� - Obfuscated banner

Port 445 open 
('Exception', error(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))

Port 2701 open
Banner is (SUCCESSFULLY SHOWN)

Port 3000 open
Banner not showing up :(

Port 8192 open
Banner is (SUCCESSFULLY SHOWN)

NOTE: To maintain security of the machines used, I have chosen not to reveal the banners
