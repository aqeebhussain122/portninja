#HOW TO BANNER GRAB:
Banner grabbing is an attack which retrieves system labels from servers resulting
in a better map of information as to what version the server or system maybe running

#Technical steps:
Send a HTTP request to then recieve the banner in return from a server
Send some data using UDP functions to be able to successfully interact with a UDP port
Ensure data is fully error handled and program output is reliable


#How can be achieved???
Packet injection from crafted packet using raw socket
Testing should be carried out on all platforms possible with a testing document to be submitted

## SYN flooding friendly fire mode
- Network host discovery scan to find alive hosts with randomised MAC/IP and lengthy sleep times  
- Using legitimate addresses of those on the network.  
- Attack all the hosts against each other
