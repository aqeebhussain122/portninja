# portninja
Network reconnaissance tool used for information gathering on ports and hosts 
Product in development


# Important notes
The product currently only works on the following version of Python:
Python 2.7.15rc1 (default, Nov 12 2018, 14:31:15) 
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux2
Portninja should be run on a Linux/Unix OS for the time being as there
have been some issues running portninja correctly from a Windows
machine as the scanning machine
